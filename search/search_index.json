You can use higher and lower tiers of Modifiers and IO\u2019s on any tier Void Miner multi-block, such as Tier 5 Frequency Modifiers on a Tier 2 Void Miner multi-block.  This is important to note, as the Tier 1 Void Miner needs more power than one Tier 1 FE Input can give the multi-block.  The solution is to either use your first two Erodium to upgrade your FE Input, or to use two Tier 1 FE Inputs on your Tier 1 Void Miner.</p> What is Duration &amp; Tick Costs? <code>Duration</code> Is how long it will take the miner, provided that it has the tick cost worth of energy supplied, to generate an item.  <code>Tick Cost</code> Is the energy required per tick to allow the miner to mine at the maximum speed that is currently possible with all modifiers included. If you don\u2019t provide the tick cost amount of energy or more then your Void Miner will be slower. View Modifiers Frequency | Speeds up miners - Duration.<pre><code>Increases the speed of the Void Miner operation. This is visually displayed on the Void Miner CCU labeled as 'Duration'. Duration is measured in ticks needed per operation. 20 ticks is equal to 1 second in real life if you are running at 20 FPS. 1,000 Duration (or 1,000 ticks) is equal to 50 seconds. \n\nThe Duration is lowered by upgrading your Frequency Modifiers, or by adding more Frequency Modifiers. Once your Duration hits 0, the item generation rate cannot go faster. Any further Frequency Modifiers will not affect the Void Miner's speed. They will only increase the Tick Cost.\n</code></pre> Bandwidth | Increases amount of mined items<pre><code>Increases the possible maximum stack size of each mined drop up to 64 items per single operation. Bandwidth Modifiers cannot be crafted until you generate Tier 5 Ionite Crystals at Tier 4 Void Miner (Pladium). Without any Bandwidth Modifiers, a Void Miner will produce 1 item per operation always\n</code></pre> Amplification | Gives Lenses more Accuracy (High Drop Rate).<pre><code>Increases the chance of getting the preferred ores with the Colored Lens the player is using. This is not a commonly used Modifier as in the later tiers of the Void Miner you will be producing hundreds of ores in fractions of a second (lmao)\n\nFor example:\n    - Tier 2 Void Miner / Four Tier 2 Frequency Modifiers / No Lens = 5.61% chance for Gold Ore at 180 Duration (one operation per 9 seconds)\n    - Tier 2 Void Miner / Four Tier 2 Frequency Modifiers / Yellow Lens = 32.22% chance for Gold Ore at 180 Duration\n    - Tier 2 Void Miner / Four Tier 2 Amplification Modifiers / Yellow Lens = 38.24% chance for Gold Ore at 320 Duration (one operation per 16 seconds)\n</code></pre> Dimensional<pre><code>Allows Void Miner to gain any drop in the current dimension and requires two Tier 5 structure frames to craft. Interdimensional Modifier allows Void Miner to gain any drops from any dimension. \n</code></pre> Piezo<pre><code>Allows solars to gen in rain/thunderstorms from vibrations.\n</code></pre> Electrostatic<pre><code>Allows Lightning rods to gen passively in rain and thunder.\n</code></pre> Radian<pre><code>Allows lightning rod to gen passively in sunny weather.\n</code></pre> <p>Note: Modifiers also have tiers based on crystal tiers respectively</p>"},{"location":"atm6/envtech/#flash-memory","title":"Flash Memory","text":"<p>Creating a Flash Memory Card for Void Miner is vital for Void Miner resource generation.

If successful, you\u2019ll see a blood circle on the ground, and a mana bar (Mahou X/Y) somewhere on your screen. Note: there is a dagger to damage yourself, if you prefer.</p> Alarm Boundary <p>The Alarm Boundary is perhaps the most basic of boundary magic - it simply alerts you to mobs and players as they enter the range of the boundary.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster every second(s).</p> <p>Alarm boundaries will also output a comparator value of 15 when it detects anything in the boundary.</p> Alchemical Exchange <p>This circle will, once a day around the time of placement, convert blocks underneath it into random other blocks of the same class. For example, dirt may become sand, diamonds may become emeralds, etc. However, this only works on natural blocks, and will not work on things such as bricks or diamond blocks.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster per transformation.</p> Ascension <p>This spell, when used without a cloth, will teleport any thing (including items and mobs) on top of it to the highest solid Y value it can find.

Players, however, can escape this binding by simply breaking eye contact.</p> <p>It drains mana on use.</p> Black Flame Eyes <p>When used, black flames will sprout at the caster\u2019s viewing location for a short time.

You can turn them on and off by right clicking them. A redstone signal will also invert their on/off status.</p> <p>Boundaries give off comparator output - 0 when off, 1 when on.</p> <p>Lastly, boundary scrolls can be used to quickly place boundaries in another location.</p> Butterfly Effect <p>When this scroll is used, the caster is granted Foresight for a short duration. During this time, breaking/placing a block, or swinging a weapon will be delayed for the future. A butterfly will mark the spot, and things colliding with this butterfly will trigger its effect.</p> <p>WARNING: DO NOT USE ON IMPORTANT BLOCKS.</p> <p>This spell drains mana from the caster upon use.</p> Catalyst Exchange <p>When placed on the floor, this circle will convert any powdered catalysts on top of it into a new random powdered catalyst.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster per transformation.</p> Catalysts <p>There are seven catalysts representing each of the known categories of magic. Powdered Catalysts are created by taking a Hammer or a Mortar and Pestle, and smashing these catalysts. </p> <p>The categories are:</p> <ul> <li>Iron - Boundaries</li> <li>Ender Pearl - Displacement</li> <li>Diamond - Projection</li> <li>Emerald - Exchange</li> <li>Gold - Mystic</li> <li>Quartz - Intelligence</li> <li>Ender Eye - Mystic Eyes</li> </ul> Categories <ul> <li>Boundaries deal with AOE effects centered on a magic circle.</li> <li>Displacement spells deal with teleportation magic.</li> <li>Projection spells deal with weapons.</li> <li>Exchange spells usually involve a trade of some sort, often to refund or generate mana.</li> <li>Mystic spells are unique, often offensive spells, which provide miscellaneous effects.</li> <li>Mystic Eyes spells deal with sight based effects.</li> <li>Intelligence spells deal with decision making, often focused around entities.</li> </ul> <p>There are also some rumored secret spells..</p> Chronal Exchange <p>When placed on the floor, this circle will generate mana for 12 hours, centered on the time of placement. For the other 12 hours, it will drain mana from the caster, gems, or mana circuits.</p> <p>It will drain or restore up to mana every so often, depending on how far it is from its peak. Note that skipping time will only delay the cycle, instead of skipping it.</p> Circuits <p>Mana Circuits are blocks which store mana. Mana in them can be used by the player when nearby, as long as the player owns the block. Whoever right clicks a mana circuit first after it is placed owns the block. Right click to put mana in. Shift right click to turn it on or off. Mana Circuits can be right clicked with Fae Essence to open them to use by other players.</p> Clairvoyance <p>When used, the caster will be able to see the predicted path of certain mobs. Unfortunately, some mobs are an enigma and cannot be predicted accurately, such as skeletons.</p> <p>It drains mana on use.</p> Clarent <p>A strengthened sword forged in dragon\u2019s breath, Clarent has one purpose: to overthrow the king.</p> <p>Rather than retaining a damage value, Clarent instead does the damage of its opponent\u2019s weapon.</p> <p>Clarent\u2019s passive, Vengeance, allows it to block attacks. Clarent remembers these attacks, and in its next attack will release its pent up frustrations.</p> <p>Lastly, Clarent has the ability to mortally wound its target, leaving them wounds that will damage them should they move too quickly.</p> Contract <p>When two players create their own contract circles, and stand on them nearby, a contract will be formed between the players. Contracts allow players to bypass certain effects such as boundaries and some mystic eyes. To break a contract, one player need only damage the other.</p> <p>It drains mana from each player when a contract is formed.</p> Cup Of Heaven <p>The most complex spell, and used primarily as a way of applying mass negative effects. When many of these circles are placed on the floor and activated by a scroll, the external convex polygon (google: Graham Scan) is calculated. The prime factors in the external polygon and those in the internal polygon determine the negative effects. All mobs and players within the external polygon at the time of activation receive these effects.</p> <p>For example, if a pentagon is made with 5 of these circles, with 4 internal circles (placed anywhere inside the pentagon), the affected mobs will receive Poison 2 and Blindness 1. Why? 4 = 2 * 2. The prime factor 2 maps to poison, and the prime factor 5 maps to blindness. These prime factors go up to 13, including Poison (2), Weakness (3), Blindness (5), Slowness(7), Wither (11), Levitation (13). </p> <p>For a cup of heaven which grants poison 1 and wither 1, for example, you could simply create a 22-sided polygon and all mobs inside would be affected.</p> <p>Mana cost varies depending on the effects and area covered.</p> Damage Exchange <p>When used, the player will convert damage taken into mana a set number of times (not time-based).</p> <p>It drains mana on use.</p> Damage Replication <p>When used on another mob or player, this scroll will replicate damage and potions that affect the caster to the target.</p> <p>It drains mana on using the scroll.</p> Death Collection Eyes <p>When used, the caster collects souls upon seeing death - this death can occur in any way, but the caster does have to be looking at it. If the caster has collected enough souls, their death will be prevented in exchange for souls, whether or not the eyes are active.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster on use.</p> Displacement Boundary <p>The Displacement Boundary teleports entities that attempt to enter the range of the boundary to the other side of the boundary. In doing so, it will attempt to displace blocks that would suffocate said entity.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster every second(s).</p> Drain Life Boundary <p>The Boundary of Drain Life slowly drains health from nearby mobs in a range of. For every health drained, health, hunger, or mana is restored to the caster, in that order, according to the caster\u2019s needs.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster every second(s).</p> Durability Exchange <p>When placed on the floor, this circle will convert the durability of items on top of it into mana. Alternatively, it can do so from a chest underneath it as well.</p> <p>It can restore a maximum of mana per second. Note that higher durability items are consumed faster.</p> Emrys <p>A staff named after it\u2019s original owner, a backwards mage who couldn\u2019t decide which weapon was his favorite, Emrys is intended to be used in the off-hand. It provides strength in the form of lightning to an empty right hand, melee weapons, and some projectile weapons.</p> <p>The mage who created the staff luckily documented his struggles - simply get struck by lightning while holding a strengthened stick.</p> Enclosure Boundary <p>The Enclosure Boundary raises the floor around you to create a makeshift set of walls with radius.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster for every layer of blocks that it raises.</p> Equivalent Displacement <p>An Equivalent Displacement circle on the ground can be linked (by shift-right-clicking) to another equivalent displacement circle anywhere in the world or across dimensions. However, a teleport between the two can only happen if there is something on BOTH circles. That something can be an item or mob, and the chunks must be loaded.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster per teleport.</p> Explosion Staff <p>This scroll summons a staff with explosive power. The staff has a long charge up time (the beam in the middle indicates readiness), and creates a large explosion. Shift right clicking with the staff will change it to fire multiple, smaller, explosions, and shift right clicking again will enable a beam mode.</p> <p>When in beam mode the staff\u2019s damage accelerates the longer the beam is held. Also, the beam will destroy blocks it comes in contact with.</p> <p>The scroll drains mana from the caster, mana when using the large explosion mode, mana when using the AOE explosion mode, and mana per tick when using the beam mode.</p> Fae <p>The Fae are spiritlike creatures that occasionally roam the earth. Like leylines, they can also only be seen with Mystic Eyes of Fay Sight. Their laughter sounds like bells, and they drop Fae Essence upon death.</p> <p>The Fae are particularly attracted to magic being performed on leypoints.</p> <p>They are breedable through the use of any Powdered Catalyst.</p> Fae Essence <p>Fae Essence is dropped by the fae. Right clicking with fae essence will place a fae circle. Scrolls and stationary circles created by fae essence can be used by anyone. You can claim a fae circle by right clicking it, and it will drain mana from you when used. Most importantly, because Fae Essence is not bound to a user, it is ideal for automated scroll creation.</p> Faecake <p>Like a cupcake, but with fae essence. Watching you eat this disgusts the Fae, to the point where they will avoid you even if you perform magic on a leypoint. Reawakening the Mystic Eyes of Fay Sight is a good way to get rid of the effects of the faecake, as the Fae are quite partial to those who can see them.</p> Fallen Down <p>Give your friends, enemies and acquaintances the burial they deserve! It may be best not to do this near things you care about, though.</p> <p>This spell costs mana every fifth of a second. Naturally, the longer you channel it, the deeper the grave. Your friends should thank you, really. Note: Flight is a natural counter to this spell.</p> <p>If you shift right click with a Fallen Down scroll, it will switch to beam mode, which will terraform and burn the surrounding mobs and land.</p> Familiar Exchange <p>When used, the caster will switch places with the familiar if it exists.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster on use.</p> Familiars Garden <p>When used while a familiar is active, the familiar will activate its garden. Mobs and players in the garden will not be able to harm each other. The affected area moves with the familiar, and particles are produced to show the area.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster on use.</p> Fay Sight Eyes <p>Very simply, this spell allows the player to see Leylines and the Fae.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster on use.</p> Fog Projector <p>The Fog Projector is a decorative block which can be used to display and control two types of fog - particle and camera-based. It allows you to control the color as well as thickness of each type of fog, along with other attributes.</p> Gandr <p>A primeval curse which gains power based on the user\u2019s magical capability. Requiring a percentage of the user\u2019s mana capacity, when fired, this curse scales damage depending on the amount of mana spent to fire it.</p> <p>Furthermore, this curse will absorb and cleanse any negative effects the user may be experiencing, and spread them around its point of impact.</p> Geas <p>Geasa are self-imposed taboos. By placing a geas on oneself, you can prevent yourself from doing some undesirable things.</p> <p>For example, using it on a player will prevent you from harming that player. Using it on a sheep will prevent you from harming any sheep.</p> <p>Using it on a named sheep will prevent you from harming that specific sheep. Lastly, using it on a dropped item, will prevent you from picking up that item. Use it without a target to see your current geasa. Creating and removing geasa costs mana each, and having many geasa targeting unnamed mobs will regenerate mana. </p> Gems <p>If you craft an Attuner with a Diamond or Emerald, you can get an attuned gem. These gems will store mana for you, if you right click while holding the gem. Spells will automatically draw from any gems on your person.</p> Gravity Boundary <p>The Gravity Boundary increases the gravity for mobs other than the caster in an area of range.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster every second(s).</p> Immunity Exchange <p>This scroll can be used on either the player or something the player is looking at. The target of the scroll will take no damage from repeated damage sources, but will take double damage from a damage source that was different from the last one.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster on use.</p> Insight <p>The Mystic Eyes of Insight allow the user to see more information about a target, such as its inventory, and, in the case of living creatures, their buffs, debuffs, etc. The mana cost is per scroll.</p> Kodoku <p>Kodoku refers to the practice of encouraging conflict between a number living things, and then harnessing the strongest surviving thing\u2019s essence for power using special Kodoku worms.</p> <p>Every time a monster kills something, their kodoku value goes up by 1, plus the kodoku value of the monster it killed. When you have a specimen with a high kodoku value, simply place a hungry kodoku worm on it (right-click) and kill the specimen.</p> <p>When a worm consumes the essence of a mob with a high kodoku value, you can simply right-click to pick it up. Worms with high kodoku values have a number of uses.</p> <p>When burned, these worms will generate mana for any nearby mana circuits. The amount of mana depends on how close to a leyline the burning occurred.</p> <p>These worms can also be used for sympathetic magic.</p> <p>Sympathetic Magic refers to a symbolic magic, in which a target can be affected remotely through the use of a symbol.</p> <p>To use a scrying circle for sympathetic magic, it must be actively scrying something. Also, an inventory under the scrying circle must contain Kodoku worms to act as fuel. Worms with higher kodoku values will increase the chance of successful sympathetic magic.</p> <p>When an active scrying circle with Kodoku worms underneath is set up, simply throw items for various effects on top of the circle.</p> <ul> <li>Blaze Powder - Fire</li> <li>Rabbit Foot - Hop</li> <li>Splash Potions - Effects</li> <li>Glowstone Dust - Glowing</li> <li>Rotten Flesh - Hunger</li> <li>Kodoku worms - Misfortune</li> </ul> <p>Misfortune applies various effects such as being struck by lightning, dropping items, negative looting, tripping, breaking tools, increased aggro, with chances scaling depending on the quality of the worm.</p> <ul> <li>Ender Pearl - Teleports target (Players must have a contract with caster to be teleported)</li> <li>Nether Wart - Confusion</li> </ul> <p>You can counter sympathetic magic against yourself by keeping a worm with a high kodoku value in your inventory. The higher the value, the less likely the magic will succeed against you, and there\u2019s even a chance it will be reflected to the caster.</p> Leylines <p>Leylines connect certain points throughout the world. They can only be seen with Mystic Eyes of Fay Sight. Being near a leyline or leypoint increases mana regeneration based on a percentage of your maximum mana.</p> <p>The Fae spawn near leylines.</p> <p>Furthermore, Leylines will boost elytra if you fly along the leyline.</p> Magic <p>To perform Magic, we need a few things - mana, (optionally, depending on the recipe) a cloth, a blood circle, and 3 powdered catalysts. If the recipe is for a scroll, you\u2019d put the cloth down first, and then draw a blood circle on top. Otherwise, simply put the circle on the floor. Take your powdered catalysts and right click the circle to add them to it.</p> Mana <p>Using mana increases your maximum mana capacity over time - it\u2019s like exercising. You will naturally recover some mana over time, depending on how full your hunger is. Sleeping will regen a good chunk of your mana, and sleep is important, so sleep often!</p> Mental Displacement <p>A mental displacement scroll allows the caster to temporarily leave his body behind and explore the world in a certain radius.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster on use.</p> Morgan <p>This wicked sword is the result of the corruption of the holy sword Caliburn. Obtained through the murder of a player\u2019s best and most loyal friend with the holy sword Caliburn, this sword obtains its power not from a mysterious lake, but from the killing of innocents.</p> <p>Villagers, and more so, child villagers, provide a damage bonus for this sword (requires mana), and also heal any damage the sword has.</p> <p>Holding right click with this sword releases a ball of evil to stab and pull nearby enemies. Lastly, pressing the keybind with the sword equipped provides a Rage effect, which very briefly boosts attack speed and walking speed.</p> <p>Both of these abilities invoke a cooldown that prevents either from being used.</p> Mystic Code <p>The Mystic Code is an item which holds three stacks of scrolls. Shift right click opens the inventory. The keybind switches between the scrolls. Clicking or holding right click uses the currently selected scroll.</p> Mystic Code First Sorcery <p>The Mystic Code - First Sorcery is a variant of the mystic code, which has a set durability, but also allows for the reuse of scrolls it contains.</p> Ordered Displacement <p>An Ordered Displacement circle on the ground teleports any thing on top of it to a nearby Ordered Displacement circle. Which one it teleports you to depends on the order in which you placed the circles. You can sneak to stop teleporting.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster per teleport.</p> Power Consolidation <p>This circle, when placed on the floor, will spawn a lake. Each growth of the lake costs mana. When the lake has reached full size, the caster can throw in an enchanted sword in order to get Caliburn, a holy sword which will have the damage of the sword plus extra based on its enchantments. (hint: holier is better!)</p> <p>Exchanging a sword costs mana.</p> <p>The holy sword, Caliburn, has several properties. First, undead and unholy monsters will fear it and attempt to flee. Second, right-clicking will pull both the caster and such monsters closer. Using the keybind, the sword can smite such monsters, with a cooldown. As Caliburn is a sword, the Power Consolidation process can be repeated by simply enchanting it.</p> <p>Caliburn seems to have some innate limits - maybe there are some items you could offer to the lake with Caliburn, as proof of your purity, to remove these limits?</p> Presence Concealment <p>A Scroll of Presence Concealment grants the user the two Rippers in exchange for mana.</p> <p>When one Ripper is wielded, right clicking will create a thick fog around either the user, or a target the user was looking at. Doing the above with a Ripper in either hand will provide true presence concealment, in addition to the fog, rendering the player and his items invisible.</p> <p>Because The Rippers are intended to be dual wielded, it is possible to attack with both simultaneously. Furthermore, attacking from behind a target with a Ripper will deal bonus damage.</p> <p>Take note that your invisibility will disappear temporarily after you attack, but it will return shortly after. Monsters may or may not be able to track you after you disappear again, so it is recommended to move quickly.</p> Probability Alter <p>Place at least 2 of these circles on the floor within range of the caster, each with a chorus fruit (see config) on top.</p> <p>The number of nearby circles with chorus fruits when the scroll version of this spell is used becomes the Modulus of the Rule Breaker given by the scroll. This scroll costs mana to use. See Rule Breaker\u2019s page for more details.</p> Projectile Displacement <p>A Projectile Displacement scroll teleports you to the last arrow you shot.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster on use.</p> Projection <p>The first use of this scroll memorizes a tool or weapon you\u2019re looking at (for the whole stack!). The second use gives you a copy of the tool with limited durability.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster each time the scroll is used.</p> Projector <p>The Mahoujin Projector is a decorative block, which simply displayes runes and a magic circle. Right clicking on the block allows you to configure the size, angle, color, speed, etc. You can load in custom circles and runes through the config.</p> <p>The Mahoujin Projector is also wearable! Right click with an armor item on a projector to receive a special enchantment that displays that projector\u2019s settings. Right click again to get new settings after modifying.</p> <p>Also, you can copy and paste from projector to projector by right clicking to copy, and shift right clicking to paste with a normal stick.</p> Protective Displacement <p>Ever wondered what it\u2019s like to be an Enderman? The Protective Displacement scroll will randomly teleport you when you would otherwise have been hit by an arrow.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster when used, and provides a set number of teleports - it is not time based.</p> Proximity Projection <p>Using this scroll grants the caster a weapon, which allows the caster to simultaneously teleport to and attack an entity they can see at long range.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster on use of the scroll.</p> Reality Marble <p>This scroll teleports the user (and optionally, a target the user is looking at) to a fixed spot in the Reality Marble. If the user has a target, one of the two must die for the other to leave. Otherwise, taking damage will allow the player to leave.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster on use.</p> Recall Familiar <p>When used, the player\u2019s familiar, if it exists, will be recalled to the player.</p> <p>It drains mana on use.</p> Replica <p>When you\u2019re done defending yourself, it\u2019s about time you start defending your friends. Replica is a mainhand greatshield with a number of abilities, granted to those who have just about maxed out their defensive capabilities, yet still feel the need to use a shield.</p> <p>Note the following controls carefully:</p> <p>AOE Teleportation: Save a location with shift+right click. Teleport to it later, along with everything around you by blocking with the shield and pressing. Break a block with Replica to toggle teleporting friendlies only.</p> <p>Cover Move: Sprint towards a teammate and block to place yourself between them and their closest, most threatening enemy.</p> <p>Shockwave: Simply blocking with this greatshield is enough to knockback surrounding opponents, dealing damage according to the number of nearby allies you have.</p> <p>Replicate: Replica has the ability to remember up to 6 damage types that it has blocked. You can choose Shockwave\u2019s damage type by pressing.</p> <p>Note that allies refers to those for which the wielder of Replica has a geas or a contract with.</p> <p>To get Replica, block an attack with a strengthened shield, in your main hand, while also having Immunity Exchange, maximum Damage Absorption stacks, above 15 armor, and over 100 Death Collection souls .</p> Retribution <p>A Scroll of Retribution exchanges the health percentage of the caster with the health percentage of the target. It drains mana based on the difference between the user and target\u2019s health. The cost is times the difference in health points.</p> Reversion Eyes <p>When used, mobs and players in the caster\u2019s view will lose their buffs, along with certain other qualities, depending on the mob. Water mobs will no longer breathe underwater - nether mobs will be affected by fire and lava. Endermen, Shulker boxes and the Wither will no longer be immune to arrows. Husks can catch fire in the sun.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster on use.</p> Rho Aias <p>This scroll creates a large shield in front of the caster in the direction it is used. Mobs bounce off of it, and various projectiles are deleted by it. If desired, the caster can also bounce on it by sneaking.</p> <p>It drains mana on use.</p> Rhongomyniad <p>The Holy Lance, Rhongomyniad, is acquired by throwing a lance into the lake of a Power Consolidation ritual. The Lance Which Brings Stability to the World, Rhongomyniad, can first and foremost act as a normal lance - it can unseat opponents in a joust, depending on its weight and damage, and the speed of the rider. Furthermore, mounted wielders of Rhongomyniad will gain speed in the presence of evil.</p> <p>Rhongomyniad can be placed using shift right-click, where it assumes its role as a purveyor of punishment. Evil creatures and persons, including those who would do harm to those who are not evil, will be smitten within Rhongomyniad\u2019s range, according to Rhongomyniad\u2019s current attack damage. This will continually drain mana. Right click on the placed lance to re-collect it.</p> Rule Breaker <p>Acquired through the use of the Probability Alter spell, this dagger allows the user to control their personal probability through the Modulus and Dividend of the dagger. While the modulus is set at creation, the dagger\u2019s dividend can be increased by shift right clicking. Specifically, when right clicking with Rule Breaker, the caster will receive a timed buff that returns a specific random number when requested from the player.</p> <p>Furthermore, this effect is also applied when hitting things with the dagger.</p> Scrying <p>A Scrying circle on the ground allows the player to see a named mob or player from afar, for a short amount of time. Simply drop a nametag on the circle, and if a mob or player with this name exists, it will be shown with its surroundings.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster per nametag.</p> Selective Displacement <p>Use this scroll to receive a buff. While active, tap the0 keybind to swap places with a target entity. Alternatively, hold the keybind to select two entities, and switch them instead.</p> <p>There is a short cooldown between swaps. This scroll costs mana.</p> Shared Vision <p>When used on a mob or player, the caster will see through its eyes.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster on use.</p> Spatial Disorientation <p>Using this scroll summons a staff which can be used on an entity to launch them in the direction the caster is looking. Longer charge time provides more velocity. Alternatively, when used on a block, nearby entities will be pulled in and launched, after a charge up time. It drains mana from the caster on use of the scroll, mana when used on an entity, and mana per second when used in AOE mode.</p> Strengthening <p>A Strengthening scroll will strengthen the first thing on your hotbar, or your off-hand if you\u2019re holding something. Strengthened items are temporarily unbreakable, do more damage, and have increased mining capabilities.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster on use.</p> Summon Familiar <p>When used, the player summons a familiar. This familiar will report on interesting players, mobs, and blocks that it sees, and will chunk load the area around it. You can right click a familiar with a block to make it only report that block if it finds one. Right clicking without a block will reset this.</p> <p>It drains mana on use.</p> Tangible Boundary <p>The Tangible Boundary is a large invisible barrier with range that you can pass through, but mobs, arrows, and other entities cannot. It will not replace solid blocks other than grass, nor will it replace water.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster every second(s).</p> Treasury Projection <p>This scroll give the user a gauntlet which will project weapons and tools from the user\u2019s treasury - their inventory, some modded bags, and their ender chest, and fling them at the target block they are looking at.</p> <p>It drains mana on using the scroll, and mana per weapon projected.</p> <p>The gauntlet has two other modes upon pressing shift right-click. In AOE mode, weapons will be fired from behind you towards the direction you\u2019re looking at, and in Chains mode, chains will spawn near the target you\u2019re looking at and, if the target is a creature, attempt to hit them when right-click is held while staring at it. </p> Weapon Projectiles <p>Using this scroll grants the caster a bow, which can shoot tools and weapons.</p> <p>It drains mana from the caster on use of the scroll.</p>"},{"location":"atm6/mahou/caliburn/","title":"Caliburn","text":""},{"location":"atm6/mahou/caliburn/#caliburn","title":"Caliburn","text":""},{"location":"atm6/mahou/caliburn/#step-4","title":"Step 4","text":"<p>Allocate three large areas to your Mahou Tsukai adventure (I use a 19x19 area for the Mahou lake, a 10x10 area for the mob damage farm, and a 11x9 area for the villager kill farm)</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"atm6/mahou/caliburn/#step-5-enchant-a-diamond-sword","title":"Step 5.

It requires a certain level (mine was 46) to be selectable. Now replace one of the 16 placed <code>Seashelf</code> with your <code>Infused Seashelf</code>. Repeat this until all the original <code>Seashelf</code> have been replaced by their infused variant.  </p> <p>After this, you\u2019ll need to break 9 of the <code>Infused Seashelf</code> and make 2 <code>Heart-Forged Seashelf</code> and 7 <code>Crystalline Seashelf</code>. Place these down where the original 9 were.  </p> <p>Now, you will need to make 10 of the <code>Deepshelf</code>. With your current setup, you should be able to infuse each and every <code>Deepshelf</code>. Infuse all 10. Do not place any of them down just yet.  </p> <p>After infusing all 10, make 5 of the <code>Soul-Touched Deepshelf</code> and 5 <code>Echoing Deepshelf</code>. Then, upgrade them to their <code>Sculkshelf</code> variant. Press U or right click on the respective shelf in JEI to see what the recipe is to upgrade them.  </p> <p>It is now time to make some other shelves that don\u2019t require any infusion. You will need to make 3 <code>Shelf of End-Fused Rectification</code>. This might require some work.  </p> <p>You will also need to make a <code>Draconic Endshelf</code>. To make the <code>Infused Dragon's Breath</code>, place down the 10 Sculkshelves made earlier and add 10 <code>Melonshelf</code>. A setup for this can be seen below; the placement of the shelves does not have to be exact.  </p> <p> </p> <p>After making the <code>Draconic Endshelf</code>, remove the 10 <code>Melonshelf</code>.

The heap size is limited in replica servers so that even Full GCs do not trigger SIP retransmissions. -Xms sets the starting size to prevent pauses caused by heap expansion. <ul> <li><code>UseG1GC</code></li> </ul> Use the Garbage First (G1) Collector. <ul> <li><code>+ParallelRefProcEnabled</code></li> </ul> Optimizes the GC process to use multiple threads for weak reference checking. Not sure why this isn\u2019t default\u2026 <ul> <li><code>MaxGCPauseMillis=200</code></li> </ul> This setting controls how much memory is used in between the Minimum and Maximum ranges specified for your New Generation. This is a \u201cgoal\u201d for how long you want your server to pause for collections. 200 is aiming for at most loss of 4 ticks. This will result in a short TPS drop, however the server can make up for this drop instantly, meaning it will have no meaningful impact to your TPS. 200ms is lower than players can recognize. In testing, having this value constrained to an even lower number results in G1 not recollecting memory fast enough and potentially running out of old gen triggering a Full collection. Just because this number is 200 does not mean every collection will be 200. It means it can use up to 200 if it really needs it, and we need to let it do its job when there is memory to collect. <ul> <li><code>+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions</code></li> </ul> Needed for some the below options <ul> <li><code>+DisableExplicitGC</code></li> </ul> Many plugins think they know how to control memory, and try to invoke garbage collection. Plugins that do this trigger a full garbage collection, triggering a massive lag spike. This flag disables plugins from trying to do this, protecting you from their bad code. <ul> <li><code>+AlwaysPreTouch</code></li> </ul> AlwaysPreTouch gets the memory setup and reserved at process start ensuring it is contiguous, improving the efficiency of it more. This improves the operating systems memory access speed. Mandatory to use Transparent Huge Pages. <ul> <li><code>G1NewSizePercent</code></li> </ul> These are the important ones. You now can specify percentages of an overall desired range for the new generation. With these settings, we tell G1 to not use its default 5% for new gen, and instead give it 40%! Minecraft has an extremely high a memory allocation rate, ranging to at least 800 Megabytes a second on a 30 player server! And this is mostly short-lived objects (Block Position). <ul> <li><code>G1MaxNewSizePercent</code></li> </ul> Percentage (0-100) of the heap size to use as default maximum young gen size. <ul> <li><code>G1HeapRegionSize</code></li> </ul> Default is auto calculated. SUPER important for Minecraft, especially 1.15, as with low memory situations, the default calculation will in most times be too low. Any memory allocation half of this size (4MB) will be treated as \u201cHumongous\u201d and promote straight to old generation and is harder to free. If you allow java to use the default, you will be destroyed with a significant chunk of your memory getting treated as Humongous. <ul> <li><code>G1ReservePercent</code></li> </ul> MC Memory allocation rate in up-to-date versions is really insane. We run the risk of a dreaded \u201cto-space exhaustion\u201d not having enough memory free to move data around. This ensures more memory is waiting to be used for this operation. Default is 10, so we are giving another 10 to it. <ul> <li><code>G1HeapWastePercent</code></li> </ul> Amount of space, expressed as a percentage of the heap size, that G1 is willing not to collect to avoid expensive GCs. <ul> <li><code>G1MixedGCCountTarget</code></li> </ul> Default is 8. Because we are aiming to collect slower, with less old gen usage, try to reclaim old gen memory faster to avoid running out of old. <ul> <li><code>InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent</code></li> </ul> Percentage of the (entire) heap occupancy to start a concurrent GC cycle. GCs that trigger a concurrent GC cycle based on the occupancy of the entire heap and not just one of the generations, including G1, use this option. A value of 0 denotes \u2018do constant GC cycles\u2019. The default value is 45. <ul> <li><code>G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent</code></li> </ul> Controls when to include regions in Mixed GC\u2019s in the Young GC collection, keeping Old Gen tidy without doing a normal Old Gen GC collection. When your memory is less than this percent, old gen won\u2019t even be included in \u2018mixed\u2019 collections. Mixed are not as heavy as a full old collection, so having small incremental cleanups of old keeps memory usage light. Default is 65 to 85 depending on Java Version, we are setting to 90 to ensure we reclaim garbage in old gen as fast as possible to retain as much free regions as we can. <ul> <li><code>G1RSetUpdatingPauseTimePercent</code></li> </ul> Default is 10% of time spent during pause updating RSets, reduce this to 5% to make more of it concurrent to reduce pause durations. <ul> <li><code>SurvivorRatio</code></li> </ul> Because we drastically reduced MaxTenuringThreshold, we will be reducing use of survivor space drastically. This frees up more regions to be used by Eden instead. <ul> <li><code>+PerfDisableSharedMem</code></li> </ul> Causes GC to write to file system which can cause major latency if disk IO is high \u2013 See JVM MMAP Pause Note: This argument can prevent VisualVM from detecting the Java process. <ul> <li><code>MaxTenuringThreshold</code></li> </ul> Minecraft has a really high allocation rate of memory. Of that memory, most is reclaimed in the eden generation. However, transient data will overflow into survivor. Initially played with completely removing Survivor and had decent results, but does result in transient data making its way to Old which is not good.Max Tenuring 1 ensures that we do not promote transient data to old generation, but anything that survives 2 passes of Garbage Collection is just going to be assumed as longer-lived. Doing this greatly reduces pause times in Young Collections as copying data up to 15 times in Survivor space for a tenured object really takes a lot of time for actually old memory. Ideally the GC engine would track average age for objects instead and tenure out data faster, but that is not how it works. Considering average GC rate is 10s to the upwards of minutes per young collection, this does not result in any \u2018garbage\u2019 being promoted, and just delays longer lived memory to be collected in Mixed GC\u2019s. <ul> <li><code>+UseLargePagesInMetaspace</code></li> </ul> For Large Pages \u2013 It\u2019s even more important to use -Xms = -Xmx! Large Pages needs to have all the memory specified for it, or you could end up without the gains. This memory will not be used by the OS anyway, so use it. Additionally, use these flags (Metaspace is Java 8 Only, don\u2019t use it for Java7):  <ul> <li><code>+UseTransparentHugePages</code></li> </ul> Controversial feature but may be usable if you can not configure your host for real HugeTLBFS. Try adding, but it\u2019s extremely important you also have AlwaysPreTouch set. Otherwise, THP will likely hurt you.
