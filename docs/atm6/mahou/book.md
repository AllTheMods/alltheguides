    It drains mana from each player when a contract is formed.

??? Info "Cup Of Heaven"
    The most complex spell, and used primarily as a way of applying mass negative effects. When many of these circles are placed on the floor and activated by a scroll, the external convex polygon (google: Graham Scan) is calculated. The prime factors in the external polygon and those in the internal polygon determine the negative effects. All mobs and players within the external polygon at the time of activation receive these effects.

??? Info "Cup Of Heaven2"
    For example, if a pentagon is made with 5 of these circles, with 4 internal circles (placed anywhere inside the pentagon), the affected mobs will receive Poison 2 and Blindness 1. Why? 4 = 2 * 2. The prime factor 2 maps to poison, and the prime factor 5 maps to blindness. These prime factors go up to 13, including Poison (2), Weakness (3), Blindness (5), Slowness(7), Wither (11), Levitation (13). 

??? Info "Cup Of Heaven3"
    For a cup of heaven which grants poison 1 and wither 1, for example, you could simply create a 22-sided polygon and all mobs inside would be affected.
    
    Mana cost varies depending on the effects and area covered.

    It drains mana from the caster on use.

??? Info "Displacement Boundary"

    When placed on the floor, this circle will convert the durability of items on top of it into mana. Alternatively, it can do so from a chest underneath it as well.

??? Info "Equivalent Displacement"
    An Equivalent Displacement circle on the ground can be linked (by shift-right-clicking) to another equivalent displacement circle anywhere in the world or across dimensions. However, a teleport between the two can only happen if there is something on BOTH circles. That something can be an item or mob, and the chunks must be loaded.
    
    It drains mana from the caster per teleport.

??? Info "Explosion Staff"
    This scroll summons a staff with explosive power. The staff has a long charge up time (the beam in the middle indicates readiness), and creates a large explosion. Shift right clicking with the staff will change it to fire multiple, smaller, explosions, and shift right clicking again will enable a beam mode.

??? Info "Explosion Staff2"
    When in beam mode the staff's damage accelerates the longer the beam is held. Also, the beam will destroy blocks it comes in contact with.
    
    The scroll drains mana from the caster, mana when using the large explosion mode, mana when using the AOE explosion mode, and mana per tick when using the beam mode.

??? Info "Fae"
    The Fae are spiritlike creatures that occasionally roam the earth. Like leylines, they can also only be seen with Mystic Eyes of Fay Sight. Their laughter sounds like bells, and they drop Fae Essence upon death.
    
    The Fae are particularly attracted to magic being performed on leypoints.
   
    They are breedable through the use of any Powdered Catalyst.

??? Info "Fae Essence"
    Fae Essence is dropped by the fae. Right clicking with fae essence will place a fae circle. Scrolls and stationary circles created by fae essence can be used by anyone. You can claim a fae circle by right clicking it, and it will drain mana from you when used. Most importantly, because Fae Essence is not bound to a user, it is ideal for automated scroll creation.

??? Info "Faecake"
    Like a cupcake, but with fae essence. Watching you eat this disgusts the Fae, to the point where they will avoid you even if you perform magic on a leypoint. Reawakening the Mystic Eyes of Fay Sight is a good way to get rid of the effects of the faecake, as the Fae are quite partial to those who can see them.

??? Info "Fallen Down"
    Give your friends, enemies and acquaintances the burial they deserve! It may be best not to do this near things you care about, though.
    
    This spell costs mana every fifth of a second. Naturally, the longer you channel it, the deeper the grave. Your friends should thank you, really. Note: Flight is a natural counter to this spell.

    A primeval curse which gains power based on the user's magical capability. Requiring a percentage of the user's mana capacity, when fired, this curse scales damage depending on the amount of mana spent to fire it.
    
    Furthermore, this curse will absorb and cleanse any negative effects the user may be experiencing, and spread them around its point of impact.

??? Info "Geas"
    Geasa are self-imposed taboos. By placing a geas on oneself, you can prevent yourself from doing some undesirable things.
    
    For example, using it on a player will prevent you from harming that player. Using it on a sheep will prevent you from harming any sheep.

??? Info "Geas2"
    Using it on a named sheep will prevent you from harming that specific sheep. Lastly, using it on a dropped item, will prevent you from picking up that item. Use it without a target to see your current geasa. Creating and removing geasa costs mana each, and having many geasa targeting unnamed mobs will regenerate mana. 

??? Info "Gems"
    If you craft an Attuner with a Diamond or Emerald, you can get an attuned gem. These gems will store mana for you, if you right click while holding the gem. Spells will automatically draw from any gems on your person.

    It drains mana from the caster every second(s).

??? Info "Immunity Exchange"

    It drains mana from the caster on use.

??? Info "Insight"
    The Mystic Eyes of Insight allow the user to see more information about a target, such as its inventory, and, in the case of living creatures, their buffs, debuffs, etc. The mana cost is per scroll.

??? Info "Intro"
    A mahoutsukai, simply, is a magic user. And congrats! You are one such magic user.
   
    Let's first see how to draw a circle in blood. It's easy - just take damage, and quickly use the keybind to draw a circle in blood on the floor. If successful, you'll see a blood circle on the ground, and a mana bar (Mahou X/Y) somewhere on your screen. Note: there is a dagger to damage yourself, if you prefer.

??? Info "Kodoku"
    Kodoku refers to the practice of encouraging conflict between a number living things, and then harnessing the strongest surviving thing's essence for power using special Kodoku worms.
    
    Every time a monster kills something, their kodoku value goes up by 1, plus the kodoku value of the monster it killed. When you have a specimen with a high kodoku value, simply place a hungry kodoku worm on it (right-click) and kill the specimen.

??? Info "Kodoku2"
    When a worm consumes the essence of a mob with a high kodoku value, you can simply right-click to pick it up. Worms with high kodoku values have a number of uses.
    
    When burned, these worms will generate mana for any nearby mana circuits. The amount of mana depends on how close to a leyline the burning occurred.
   
    These worms can also be used for sympathetic magic.

??? Info "Kodoku3"
    Sympathetic Magic refers to a symbolic magic, in which a target can be affected remotely through the use of a symbol.
   
    To use a scrying circle for sympathetic magic, it must be actively scrying something. Also, an inventory under the scrying circle must contain Kodoku worms to act as fuel. Worms with higher kodoku values will increase the chance of successful sympathetic magic.

??? Info "Kodoku4"
    When an active scrying circle with Kodoku worms underneath is set up, simply throw items for various effects on top of the circle.
   
    Blaze Powder - Fire
    
    Rabbit Foot - Hop
    
    Splash Potions - Effects
    
    Glowstone Dust - Glowing
    
    (Effects continued on next page.)

??? Info "Kodoku5"
   
    Rotten Flesh - Hunger
    
    Kodoku worms - Misfortune
   
    Misfortune applies various effects such as being struck by lightning, dropping items, negative looting, tripping, breaking tools, increased aggro, with chances scaling depending on the quality of the worm.
    
    (Effects continued on next page.)

??? Info "Kodoku6"
   
    Ender Pearl - Teleports target (Players must have a contract with caster to be teleported)
    
    Nether Wart - Confusion

??? Info "Kodoku7"
    You can counter sympathetic magic against yourself by keeping a worm with a high kodoku value in your inventory. The higher the value, the less likely the magic will succeed against you, and there's even a chance it will be reflected to the caster.

??? Info "Leylines"
    Leylines connect certain points throughout the world. They can only be seen with Mystic Eyes of Fay Sight. Being near a leyline or leypoint increases mana regeneration based on a percentage of your maximum mana.
   
    The Fae spawn near leylines.
    
    Furthermore, Leylines will boost elytra if you fly along the leyline.

??? Info "Magic"
    To perform Magic, we need a few things - mana, (optionally, depending on the recipe) a cloth, a blood circle, and 3 powdered catalysts. If the recipe is for a scroll, you'd put the cloth down first, and then draw a blood circle on top. Otherwise, simply put the circle on the floor. Take your powdered catalysts and right click the circle to add them to it.

??? Info "Mana"
    Using mana increases your maximum mana capacity over time - it's like exercising. You will naturally recover some mana over time, depending on how full your hunger is. Sleeping will regen a good chunk of your mana, and sleep is important, so sleep often!

??? Info "Mental Displacement"
    A mental displacement scroll allows the caster to temporarily leave his body behind and explore the world in a certain radius.
    
    It drains mana from the caster on use.

??? Info "Morgan"
    This wicked sword is the result of the corruption of the holy sword Caliburn. Obtained through the murder of a player's best and most loyal friend with the holy sword Caliburn, this sword obtains its power not from a mysterious lake, but from the killing of innocents.
    
    Villagers, and more so, child villagers, provide a damage bonus for this sword (requires mana), and also heal any damage the sword has.

??? Info "Morgan2"
    Holding right click with this sword releases a ball of evil to stab and pull nearby enemies. Lastly, pressing the keybind with the sword equipped provides a Rage effect, which very briefly boosts attack speed and walking speed.
   
    Both of these abilities invoke a cooldown that prevents either from being used.

??? Info "Mystic Code"
    The Mystic Code is an item which holds three stacks of scrolls. Shift right click opens the inventory. The keybind switches between the scrolls. Clicking or holding right click uses the currently selected scroll.

??? Info "Mystic Code First Sorcery"
    The Mystic Code - First Sorcery is a variant of the mystic code, which has a set durability, but also allows for the reuse of scrolls it contains.

??? Info "No Cloth"
    undefined

??? Info "Ordered Displacement"
    An Ordered Displacement circle on the ground teleports any thing on top of it to a nearby Ordered Displacement circle. Which one it teleports you to depends on the order in which you placed the circles. You can sneak to stop teleporting.
    
    It drains mana from the caster per teleport.

??? Info "Power Consolidation"
    This circle, when placed on the floor, will spawn a lake. Each growth of the lake costs mana. When the lake has reached full size, the caster can throw in an enchanted sword in order to get Caliburn, a holy sword which will have the damage of the sword plus extra based on its enchantments. (hint: holier is better!)
    
    Exchanging a sword costs mana.

??? Info "Power Consolidation2"
    The holy sword, Caliburn, has several properties. First, undead and unholy monsters will fear it and attempt to flee. Second, right-clicking will pull both the caster and such monsters closer. Using the keybind, the sword can smite such monsters, with a cooldown. As Caliburn is a sword, the Power Consolidation process can be repeated by simply enchanting it.

??? Info "Power Consolidation3"
    Caliburn seems to have some innate limits - maybe there are some items you could offer to the lake with Caliburn, as proof of your purity, to remove these limits?

??? Info "Presence Concealment"
    A Scroll of Presence Concealment grants the user the two Rippers in exchange for mana.
   
    When one Ripper is wielded, right clicking will create a thick fog around either the user, or a target the user was looking at. Doing the above with a Ripper in either hand will provide true presence concealment, in addition to the fog, rendering the player and his items invisible.

??? Info "Presence Concealment2"
    Because The Rippers are intended to be dual wielded, it is possible to attack with both simultaneously. Furthermore, attacking from behind a target with a Ripper will deal bonus damage.
   
    Take note that your invisibility will disappear temporarily after you attack, but it will return shortly after. Monsters may or may not be able to track you after you disappear again, so it is recommended to move quickly.

??? Info "Probability Alter"
    Place at least 2 of these circles on the floor within range of the caster, each with a chorus fruit (see config) on top.
    
    The number of nearby circles with chorus fruits when the scroll version of this spell is used becomes the Modulus of the Rule Breaker given by the scroll. This scroll costs mana to use. See Rule Breaker's page for more details.

??? Info "Projectile Displacement"
    A Projectile Displacement scroll teleports you to the last arrow you shot.
    
    It drains mana from the caster on use.

??? Info "Projection"
    The first use of this scroll memorizes a tool or weapon you're looking at (for the whole stack!). The second use gives you a copy of the tool with limited durability.
    
    It drains mana from the caster each time the scroll is used.

??? Info "Projector"
    The Mahoujin Projector is a decorative block, which simply displayes runes and a magic circle. Right clicking on the block allows you to configure the size, angle, color, speed, etc. You can load in custom circles and runes through the config.

??? Info "Projector2"
    The Mahoujin Projector is also wearable! Right click with an armor item on a projector to receive a special enchantment that displays that projector's settings. Right click again to get new settings after modifying.
    
    Also, you can copy and paste from projector to projector by right clicking to copy, and shift right clicking to paste with a normal stick.

??? Info "Protective Displacement"
    Ever wondered what it's like to be an Enderman? The Protective Displacement scroll will randomly teleport you when you would otherwise have been hit by an arrow.
    
    It drains mana from the caster when used, and provides a set number of teleports - it is not time based.

??? Info "Proximity Projection"
    Using this scroll grants the caster a weapon, which allows the caster to simultaneously teleport to and attack an entity they can see at long range.
    
    It drains mana from the caster on use of the scroll.

??? Info "Reality Marble"
    This scroll teleports the user (and optionally, a target the user is looking at) to a fixed spot in the Reality Marble. If the user has a target, one of the two must die for the other to leave. Otherwise, taking damage will allow the player to leave.
    
    It drains mana from the caster on use.

??? Info "Recall Familiar"
    When used, the player's familiar, if it exists, will be recalled to the player.

    Cover Move: Sprint towards a teammate and block to place yourself between them and their closest, most threatening enemy.

??? Info "Reversion Eyes"
    When used, mobs and players in the caster's view will lose their buffs, along with certain other qualities, depending on the mob. Water mobs will no longer breathe underwater - nether mobs will be affected by fire and lava. Endermen, Shulker boxes and the Wither will no longer be immune to arrows. Husks can catch fire in the sun.
    
    It drains mana from the caster on use.

??? Info "Rhongomyniad"
    The Holy Lance, Rhongomyniad, is acquired by throwing a lance into the lake of a Power Consolidation ritual. The Lance Which Brings Stability to the World, Rhongomyniad, can first and foremost act as a normal lance - it can unseat opponents in a joust, depending on its weight and damage, and the speed of the rider. Furthermore, mounted wielders of Rhongomyniad will gain speed in the presence of evil.

??? Info "Rhongomyniad2"
    Rhongomyniad can be placed using shift right-click, where it assumes its role as a purveyor of punishment.
