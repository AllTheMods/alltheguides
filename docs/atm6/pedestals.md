# Pedestals
The mod that can do just about anything.... But how?

#### Linking Tool
With a diamond and some dye, your first step into pedestals is the linking tool. This tool will allow you to make blank pedestals and blank upgrades for the pedestal

#### Cobblestone Generator
Your next step should be the cobblegen. Place a pedestal and put the cobblegen upgrade in your offhand and then right-click the pedestal to apply it. If you want to link two pedestals, shift right-click with the linking tool on the recieving pedestal and then do the same to the sending pedestal.
