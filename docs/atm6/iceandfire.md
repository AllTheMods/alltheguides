# Ice & Fire

Dragons only spawn in **The Other** dimension which you can reach by using a **Teleport Pad** in the Nether. _(Shift-right click with an empty hand, and nothing in offhand)_. Most of other ice and fire structure spawns are disabled. 


## Finding Dragons

Travel 800 blocks from spawn in **The Other**, and look for specific dragons in specific biomes. **Natures Compass** and **Spectral Eye Amulet** will help. There is also a scrying ritual from **Ars Nouveau** that can locate chests. In addition, **Corrupted Chorus Fruit** can be used to =='noclip'== through blocks, allowing you to move quickly through them and see where you're going. Higher tier dragons are in underground roosts around y35.

## Biomes

- **Lightning**: The Other: Desert, The Other: Desert Hills 
- **Fire**: The Other: Basalt Deltas
- **Ice**: The Other: Mountains

## Looting

Right click with empty hand on a dead dragon corpse too loot it.

> **Note**: Obtain Dragon Blood by right clicking a dragon corpse with a bottle. This changes the loot table so you only get bones, blood, and skulls.

## Forges

For each Dragon Forge,

- **Lightning**: Unobtainium-Allthemodium
- **Fire**: Vibranium-Allthemodium
- **Ice**: Unobtainium-Vibranium

> **Note**: Blocks (including Compressed) can be used instead of dusts, and or ingots
