# Welcome!

To the new **All The Guides**, by **All The Mods** (_ATM_).

This guide is currently a work in progress, so there's a lot of missing/placeholder information. Want to contribute? Check [About All The Guides](guides/contributing/README.md)

??? Tip "This Guide is only for our packs"
    
    ATM has custom changes and additions, mostly recipes. This means it's only for ATM packs, and may not be the same for other packs.

## Intro

Are you new to **Minecraft**, **All The Mods**, or just need help getting started? Here you'll find some **Tips** and **Guides** on getting started with **All The Mods**!

### Getting Started

**All The Mods** packs require a PC that has at least **16GB** or more system RAM :material-information-outline:{ title="Random Access Memory" } for the best <u>_playable_</u> experience.

Allocating between **8-12GB** RAM is required for most of our packs. Smaller (_Lite_) designed packs can run with at least **4GB** allocated. This <u>must</u> be changed within [Launcher](#launchers) settings. **8GB** minimum is **recommended**.

### Requirements

- [x] An official **Mojang** / **Microsoft** account for **Java Edition**.
- [x] A third-party [launcher](#launchers) that can download, install, and run our packs.
- [x] A PC with at least **16GB** or more **RAM**. :material-information-outline:{ title="Random Allocated Memory" }

### Launchers

The most common launchers are [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app), [FTB App](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/ftb-app), [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/), [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/), [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/) and [GDLauncher](https://gdlauncher.com/en/). You will need one of these launchers to install packs. Sign into your **Microsoft** account and search for the modpack of your choice to install.

!!! Info "Allocation"

    By default, in the launcher or instance (modpack) settings, **4GB** is allocated. **Recommended** MAX allocation is **8-12GB** | `8192-12288`Mb. You should **never** allocate all of or more RAM than necessary.

    Additionally, some launchers may install and use the appropriate version of [Java](help/java.md), though make sure you're using the correct version of [Java](help/java.md) for the **Minecraft** version of the pack installed.
